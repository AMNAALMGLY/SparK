## Introduction

This is an official implementation of the paper: "Designing BERT for Convolutional Networks: Sparse and Hierarchical Masked Modeling".
We'll be updating frequently these days, so you might consider star ‚≠ê or watch üëì this repository to get the latest information.

In this work we designed a BERT-style pre-training framework (a.k.a. masked image modeling) for any hierarchical (multi-scale) convnets.
As shown above, it gathers all unmasked patches to form a sparse image and uses sparse convolution for encoding.
A dense, hierarchical decoder is applied then, to reconstruct all masked pixels.
This method is general and powerful: it can be used directly on any convolutional backbones such as classical ResNets (the right) and modern ConvNeXts (left), and can bring a leap in their performance:

## Pre-train

See [PRETRAIN.md](PRETRAIN.md) for preparation and pre-training.

## Fine-tune on ImageNet

After finishing the preparation in [PRETRAIN.md](PRETRAIN.md), see [downstream_imagenet](downstream_imagenet) for subsequent instructions.

## Fine-tune ResNets on COCO

Install `Detectron2` and see [downstream_d2](downstream_d2) for more details.

## Fine-tune ConvNeXts on COCO

Install `mmcv` and `mmdetection` then see [downstream_mmdet](downstream_mmdet) for more details.
